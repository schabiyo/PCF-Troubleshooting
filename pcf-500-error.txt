Error:  500 Internal Server Error nginx 


The problem was that I had run out of space in the Director VM's persistent disk. 

Detect: I was able to see this by SSH'ing into the director VM, and running "df -h" to see the space utilization.

Resolution: Go to Ops Manager, and set the persistent disk for the director VM to 40G, and then started the deploy again
